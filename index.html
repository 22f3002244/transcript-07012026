    <h1>Transcript</h1>

    <h4 style="font-weight: 100;">
        I'm Vedant, currently a student pursuing two degrees: a BS in Data Science from IIT Madras and a BE in Computer Science Engineering from Mumbai University.

        <br><br>As an earning source, I've tried various sources and currently manage a <span class="highlight">WhatsApp community of 3,000+ members across 4 groups</span>.

        <br><br>These groups were originally created for offline promotions and sales of events for our regular clients, including clubs, concerts, and festivals. Over time, I've also seen members promoting social media services, volunteering opportunities, rental stays, and business ventures.

        <br><br><strong>Two Categories of People:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Those associated with organizing/management/ticketing partners</li>
            <li>Those who resell tickets at inflated prices, scam people, or sell fake tickets</li>
        </ul>

        <br><strong>The Industry Problem:</strong>
        <br><br>Post-COVID, we've witnessed an increasing trend in the live event industry. India's biggest ticket marketplace, <span class="highlight">BookMyShow</span>, despite being aware of illegal activities, appears to support them for personal benefits. They now produce events and manage everything from A to Z. Even if someone files a complaint, they can show booking details, leaving no legal recourse.

        <br><br><strong>Case Study: Coldplay Concerts (January 2025)</strong>
        <br>The event took place in India for 5 days: 3 days in Mumbai and 2 days in Gujarat.
        <br>Assuming the cricket stadium had a total capacity of 1 lakh people:
        <ul>
            <li>5 days = 5 lakh people</li>
            <li>Average selling price: ₹10,000</li>
            <li>Total sales: <span class="highlight">10,000 × 5,00,000 = ₹500 crore</span></li>
        </ul>

        This represents nearly <span class="highlight">₹500 crore in business from a single event</span>. The majority of tickets were resold on platforms like Viagogo and listed for lakhs of rupees.

        <br><br><strong>Zomato's Entry:</strong>
        <br><br>Observing this trend, Zomato brought Dua Lipa, a singer from the UK, for their Zomato Feeding India event. However, it flopped as 80% of tickets were being sold outside the venue at 50% less than MRP. They capitalized on the craze, did an IPO, <span class="highlight">acquired Paytm Insider for ₹2,000 crore</span>, and created District as a ticketing platform.

        <br><br><strong>District's Strategy:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides minimum guarantee (MG) to organizers to list events on their platform instead of BookMyShow</li>
            <li>Introduced QR ticketing, where tickets can be shared with others, enabling easy resale</li>
            <li>Introduced a "pay 50% now, rest later" option to achieve sales targets more easily</li>
        </ul>

        <br><strong>My Experience with Organizers:</strong>
        <br><br>I worked with Eva Live for their concert event offline ticketing sales. The founder, Deepak Chaudhary, also known as the IP Man of India, continued creating events despite past failures. They couldn't meet brand commitments of 15,000 footfalls, gave away free tickets, and postponed or cancelled many events.

        <br><br><strong>Examples of Failed Events:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Bollywood Music Project (March) - Postponed to October after Delhi event failed</li>
            <li>IGX game event - Cancelled due to poor sales</li>
        </ul>

        These organizers continue creating events because <span class="highlight">banks sponsor them and platforms like District provide MG for ticketing rights</span>.

        <br><br>Then there are groups promoting club events, such as Team Innovation and Vare Entertainment. They've created WhatsApp groups, added college students for club marketing purposes, and leveraged their network to enter concert event ticketing.

        <br><br><strong>Unfair Practices:</strong>
        <br><br>BookMyShow has acquired and managed different companies for promotion and sales:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Townscript:</strong> Platform with presence in Pune and Singapore—BookMyShow funded it and now controls event listings there</li>
            <li><strong>Spacebound:</strong> Allegedly took over India's most successful music festival, Sunburn, illegally and now owns the IP. A <span class="highlight">₹300 crore case has been filed</span> against Spacebound and BookMyShow by the owners of Sunburn (originally owned by Percept Limited)</li>
        </ul>

        BookMyShow uses these IPs and companies as co-hosts and for offline ticket sales. For example, Sunburn festivals are produced by Spacebound (acquired by BookMyShow), sold online on BookMyShow, and sold offline by Sunburn PRs.

        <br><br>Offline event sales involve getting a deal from the organizer, selling at online MRP, and earning <span class="highlight">10-20% commission on sales</span>.

        <br><br><strong>Current Market Challenge:</strong>
        <br><br>Due to the boom in AI, students aren't doing the hard work and use AI for completing tasks. As a result of lacking core skills, they look for analyst, marketing, sales, and management roles instead of focusing on their technical fields.

        <br><br>I'm currently working with Percept Live for their upcoming concert event promotion and ticketing happening in 5 cities on a commission basis. I'm struggling to promote events as <span class="highlight">80% of PRs are promoting BookMyShow and District events</span>. This is done intentionally to promote targeted events and create hype.

        <br><br><strong>My Startup Solution: SortMyEntries</strong>
        <br><br>I'm creating a website myself and recently finalized my user interface. I'm planning to create a structured system where I'm introducing a <span class="highlight">card, similar to an ATM card</span>, which will be generated for each user account.

        <br><br><strong>How the Card Works:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Acts as a ticket to every event</li>
            <li>Contains a unique 14-digit key linked to the user account and tickets booked</li>
            <li>Available digitally on the website/app (no need to carry physical card)</li>
            <li>Scanned at entry gate for automatic ticket verification</li>
            <li>Linked with government ID for age verification</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Cannot be shared with others—eliminates resale opportunities</span></li>
        </ul>

        Verification of other ticket holders will be carried out manually at the entry gate. Any breach of rules will restrict entry for all tickets purchased under that booker ID.

        <br><br><strong>Card Benefits:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepay to SortMyEntries and load credits on the card</li>
            <li>Fast payment at booking time (no payment gateway redirects or OTP verification)</li>
            <li>Credit limit system (e.g., standard card has ₹7,500 maximum limit)</li>
            <li>Upgradeable for higher limits (valid for one year)</li>
            <li>Free card upon first account creation</li>
            <li>Replaceable if lost (digital version always available on web/app)</li>
            <li>Unique ID is hashed and non-readable—prevents duplicate creation</li>
        </ul>

        <br><strong>Additional Features:</strong>
        <br><br>SortMyEntries also provides <span class="highlight">business tools for organizers</span>, including insights, AI analysis, and an AI assistant.

        <br><br><strong>Our Mission:</strong>
        <br><br>We want to create fairness in the system where <span class="highlight">families can afford tickets at fair prices</span> and experience live events instead of facing inflated rates and sacrificing special moments, whether it's a cricket match or a favorite artist's concert.

        <br><br>We seek support from artists to reach out to their real fans and love from all, so we can <span class="highlight">expand globally and become one of the major platforms from India</span>.
